[Maximizing Loan Aceeptance with Minimum Default](/https://github.com/viviaalencar/credit_risk_analysis)


Credit risk is associated with the possibility of a client failing to meet contractual obligations, such as mortgages, credit card debts, and other types of loans.

Minimizing the risk of default is a major concern for financial institutions. For this reason, commercial and investment banks, venture capital funds, asset management companies and insurance firms, to name a few, are increasingly relying on technology to predict which clients are more prone to not honoring their debts.

Machine Learning models have been helping these companies to improve the accuracy of their credit risk analysis, providing a scientific method to identify potential debtors in advance.

The aim of this work is to conduct an analysis and build a model to predict loan default, using Catboost algorithm and using these results to create a business strategy to maximize acceptance rates with minimum defaults operations.
